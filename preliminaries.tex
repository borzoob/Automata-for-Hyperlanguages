\section{Preliminaries}

An {\em alphabet} is a nonempty finite set $\Sigma$ of {\em letters}. 
%
A {\em word} over $\Sigma$ is a finite 
%or infinite 
sequence of letters from 
$\Sigma$. The {\em empty word} is denoted by $\epsilon$. The set of all finite words is denoted $\Sigma^*$.


\begin{definition}
\label{def:nfa}
A {\em nondeterministic finite-state automaton} (NFA) is a tuple \linebreak $A 
= \tuple{\Sigma,Q,Q_0,\delta,F}$, where $\Sigma$ is an alphabet, $Q$ is a 
nonempty finite set of {\em states}, $Q_0\subseteq Q$ is a set of {\em initial 
states}, $F\subseteq Q$ is a set of {\em accepting states}, and 
$\delta\subseteq Q\times\Sigma\times Q$ is a {\em transition relation}. 
\end{definition}

Given a word $w=\sigma_1\sigma_2\cdots \sigma_n$ over $\Sigma$, a 
{\em run of $A$ on $w$} is a sequence of states $q_0q_1\cdots q_n$, such 
that $q_0\in Q_0$, and for every $0 < i \leq n$, it holds that 
$(q_{i-1},\sigma_i, q_i)\in \delta$.
%
The run is {\em accepting} if $q_n\in F$. 
We say that $A$ {\em accepts} $w$ if there exists an accepting run of $A$ on $w$. 
%
The {\em language} of $A$, denoted by $\lang{A}$, is the set of all finite words that $A$ accepts.  

An NFA $A$ is called {\em deterministic} (DFA), if for every $q\in Q$ and 
$\sigma\in\Sigma$, there exists exactly one $q'$ for which $(q,\sigma,q')\in 
\delta$, i.e., $\delta$ is a transition {\em function}.
It is well-known that every NFA has an equivalent DFA.

\begin{definition}
 \label{def:nba}
A {\em nondeterministic B{\"u}chi automaton} (NBA) is a tuple \linebreak $A 
= \tuple{\Sigma,Q,Q_0,\delta,F}$, whose elements are defined as in 
Definition~\ref{def:nfa}. However, the runs of $A$ are defined over infinite 
words. An infinite word $w$ is accepted by $A$ if $A$ has an infinite run on $w$ 
that visits a state in $F$ infinitely often.
\end{definition}


As before, the language $\lang{A}$ is the set of all infinite words accepted by 
$A$. }
